# Battleships

This is a classic battleship game.
The rules are simple.
This is a game that you play against the computer.
The player Begins by placing his own ships on his map. You must put out ships that are 2, 3 or 4 columns long.
The player does not see where the computer deploys its ships.
When you have deployed your 3 ships, the game is started. Then you have to write where you want to put your first "peg" on the computer's map to guess where it has its boats. When it is a miss a "-" shows up on the map and when it is a hit a "X" show up on the map.
You guess every other time until one has sunk the other's ship.
